Catch of the Day!
=================

**Catch of the Day!** is a React SPA *(Single-Page-Application)* for a seafood restaurant acting as a management system for the orders. The project were built by me during the [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com) course.

**How to install?**

`npm install`

**How to run?**

`gulp`

**Additional things to do:**

* Improve the component's lifecycle (mounting, updating, unmounting)
* Do not let unauth users add orders, just let them see the current orders (read-only access to the Order component)
* Let owners remove one order at a time (order-=1) instead of all the orders at once
* Let owners specify a quantity of available fishes, and when there's no more immediately set the fish as "Sold Out!"
* See available stores in the index below the store selection
* Refactor more code (modularity) and improve it when needed
* Comment more code snippets for better comprehension of what's going on (for educational purposes)

*Pull request friendly :)*
